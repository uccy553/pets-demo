        },
        {
            "question": "Do I need to stay during my pet's appointment?",
            "answer": "You're welcome to stay if you'd like, but it's not required. Many pets actually do better when their owners aren't present as they're less likely to get anxious. We'll call you when your pet is ready for pickup."
        },
        {
            "question": "What if my pet is anxious or aggressive?",
            "answer": "We're experienced in handling pets with various temperaments. We use gentle, positive reinforcement techniques and can take extra time if needed. For extremely anxious pets, we can discuss strategies and may recommend shorter, more frequent visits to build trust."
        },
        {
            "question": "How often should I have my pet groomed?",
            "answer": "This depends on your pet's breed, coat type, and lifestyle. Generally, dogs need grooming every 4-8 weeks, while cats may only need professional grooming every few months. We can recommend a schedule specific to your pet."
        },
        {
            "question": "What should I bring to my pet's first appointment?",
            "answer": "Just bring your pet! If your pet has any special medical needs or sensitivities, please let us know ahead of time. We provide everything else needed for a great grooming experience."
        },
        {
            "question": "Do you groom cats as well as dogs?",
            "answer": "Absolutely! We're experienced in grooming both cats and dogs. We understand that cats require special handling techniques and we're equipped to handle all feline coat types."
        },
        {
            "question": "What vaccinations does my pet need?",
            "answer": "For the safety of all pets, we require dogs to be current on rabies, distemper, and bordetella (kennel cough) vaccinations. Cats should be current on rabies and FVRCP. Please bring proof of vaccination to your first appointment."
        },
        {
            "question": "What is your cancellation policy?",
            "answer": "We understand that things come up! We ask for at least 24 hours notice if you need to reschedule. This allows us to offer the time slot to another pet in need of grooming services."
